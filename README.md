So I was persuaded by my viewers to try teh ATTiny13 chip on the basis that it was very cheap and was "just a miniature Tiny85".  

Well, having spent a couple of days getting the Oscillation Calibration (OSCCAL) value only to find that ATMEL had already done this for me I then wondered why my serial output was not all it should have been.  

I followed **Nerd Ralph** (Ralph Doncaster) and **MCUDude** (Hans) in their quest to remove the bloat from the Serial library. Watch the video to find out what they managed to do!
